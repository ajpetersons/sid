  "description": "SID is a SImilarity Detector built to aid in detection of academic misconduct.  This tool is intended to be used by academics that are involved in detection of  academic misconduct in programming assignments, but is not limited to such  persons. SID analyzes multiple files and attempts to detect similarities among  them. Usually source code is refactored in a case of academic misconduct, thus  SID analyzes the structure of code beyond the scope of identical passages,  changes in comments, space characters or variable naming.",
